    <h2>Youth Football Coaching that Carves Character into Young Lives</h2>
    <p>At Three C, we believe that great coaching in any sport builds character in athletes.</p>
    <p>Not only that, it builds character</p>
    
<ul> 
  <li>in fans</li>
  <li>in family</li>
  <li>in friends</li>
</ul>

<p>who sweat, cheer, grunt, and bleed after the same goals.</p>

<h3>Three C Philosophy</h3>
<p>The philosophy at Three C is centered around the idea that football is a wonderful platform to learn and mature while having lots of fun.</p>

<h3>Great Resources</h3>
<p>There are lots of great resources available on the web.  Here is a list with a short description of some highly recommended resources</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="">Concussion Certification</a> - concussions are detrimental and yet their occurrance does not need to be nearly as prolific.  With a little education, coaches can minimize the frequency of head trauma.</li>
  <li><a href="">Heads Up Tackling</a> - in an effort to make football safer the idea of "Heads Up" tackling began. If taught properly, the technique here could minimize injury to your players, especially head-related injuries.</li>
  <li><a href="">Perfect Fit Tackling</a> - more of the old-school flavor, perfect fit tackling is great technique that players of any size can utilize to bring down their openents.  Some argue this form of tackling can be more dangerous than "Heads Up" but we beg to differ.</li>
</ul>
